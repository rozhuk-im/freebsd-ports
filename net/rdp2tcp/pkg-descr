rdp2tcp is a tunneling tool on top of remote desktop protocol (RDP).
It uses RDP virtual channel capabilities to multiplex several ports
forwarding over an already established rdesktop or FreeRDP session.

Available features:
 - tcp port forwarding
 - reverse tcp port forwarding
 - process stdin/out forwarding
 - SOCKS5 minimal support

The code is splitted into 2 parts:
 - the client running on the rdesktop or FreeRDP client side
 - the server running on the Terminal Server side

This port only contains client and tools.
