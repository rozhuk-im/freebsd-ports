Beetle PSX is a port/fork of Mednafen's PSX module to the libretro API.
It can be compiled in C++98 mode, excluding the Vulkan renderer, which
is written in C++11 for the time being. Beetle PSX currently runs on
Linux, OSX and Windows.

Notable additions in this fork are:
- PBP and CHD file format support, developed by Zapeth;
- Software renderer internal resolution upscaling, implemented by simias;
- An OpenGL 3.3 renderer, developed by simias;
- A Vulkan renderer, developed by TinyTiger;
- PGXP perspective correct texturing and subpixel precision, developed by iCatButler;


This port is for multimedia/kodi-devel only.
