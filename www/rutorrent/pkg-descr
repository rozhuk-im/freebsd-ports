ruTorrent is a web frontend for rtorrent designed to emulate the look
and feel of uTorrent WebUI so its appearance is quite similar to the
"parent".
The name "ruTorrent" is the combination of uTorrent and rtorrent.

The original version of ruTorrent was based on an older version of
uTorrent Webui but has been completely rewritten as of 3.0.
