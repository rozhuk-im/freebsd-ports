Installation Type: Home Assistant Core.

This port uses Virtual Environment and will download and install via pip
all required python packets on first service run or on some actions in
WebUI.

Some integrations was removed due bluetooth support not ported.
Probably some integrations can be used without bluetooth, patches and
tests required.

$ service home-assistant forcerestart
