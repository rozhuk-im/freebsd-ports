ciso8601 converts ISO 8601 or RFC 3339 date time strings into Python
datetime objects.

Since it's written as a C module, it is much faster than other Python
libraries. Tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9.

Note: ciso8601 doesn't support the entirety of the ISO 8601 spec,
only a popular subset.
