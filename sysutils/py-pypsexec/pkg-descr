This library can run commands on a remote Windows host through Python.
This means that it can be run on any host with Python and does not
require any binaries to be present or a specific OS. It uses SMB/RPC to
executable commands in a similar fashion to the popular PsExec tool.
More details on this tool can be read on this blog post.

The executable wrapper that is sent to the service is based on the
PAExec library. PAExec is an free, redistributable and open source
equivalent to Microsoft's PsExec application. This program is stored as
a binary in this package and is used to run the remote service and
start the process execution.
